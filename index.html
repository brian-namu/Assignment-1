<h1>ARSENAL MY HEART</h1>
<p>    
    I fell in love with Arsenal football club at a young age, i was around 6 when my Father introduced me to the club.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was his favorite team, we went and watched the game at his local pub in langata and i was immediately sprung.
    <br>
    <br>
    The football they played was incredible,  fluid, powerful and technical.
    <br>
    <br>
    I was not new to football at this point having watched bundesliga on tv via KBC, so it was already my favorite sport
    plus it was a good way to spend time with my father.
    <br>
    <br> 
    I had noticed that the english game was harder and more intense in the tackling than bundesliga and serie A   
    But Arsenal made football in England look attractive and graceful.
    At that time clubs such as Manchester United ruled the land.
    Blackburn rovers, Leeds United, Arsenal and Newcastle where all seen as pretenders to the thrown.
    <br>
    <br>
    I remember the feeling that arsenal was getting closer to beating those guys in Manchester, it was only a matter of time
    we kept on getting closer, pushing them to the end but we always seemed to fall short.
    <br>
    <br>
    All that changed in the 97/98 Premierleague season when we won our 1st Premierleague title since 1991.
    <br>
    <br>
    The celebration was wild and feeling of accomplishment filled me and the gooner family i was born into,
    it was a rush i will never forget.
    <br>
    <br>
     "CHAMPIONS OF ENGLAND", i couldnt stop saying it at school where i was surrounded by rivals.
     <hr>
     <p>I can speak about Arsenal all day, those memories are still fresh in my mind and lets not even go into the INVICIBLES season
    that's a whole other website on its own.
    <br>
    This current season reminds of the 1st title i saw arsenal winning, 
    it feels special and i know we have 10 games to go but i feel
    like we are rising from the ashes, that arsenal is back at the highest level.
    <br>
    Under Mikel Arteta we ar growing stronger with each game.
    <br>
    Teams are trebling at the thought of the young guns coming to town and rivals who once mocked are taking notice.
    <br>
    <br>
    WE ARE INEVITABLE.
    <br>
    <br>
